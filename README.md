# Temperature-Logger
The system on a chip (SoC) of the Raspberry Pi has a temperature sensor that can be used to measure its temperature from the command line. This projectâ€™s aim is to
create a simple Python script that can run automatically as you boot up your Raspberry Pi, take measurements from the temperature sensor at given intervals, and write them into log files that can be viewed later.
